Randraw - Random + Drawing

A program that draws random drawings each time we run it, it uses the random module and the graphics module.
Not an enormous project but an original project made by love as Code in place taught me a new library - graphics, which is new to me as I was using Tkinter earlier.
So, I am thankful to the whole CIP team for introduction me to this new field of graphics.
